- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gregory-Esman
- 👀 I’m interested in building things myself
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming in Python so I can create things in the digital world, and 3D CAD design so I can create things in the physical world
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborations, so...
- 📫 Send me a message here on GitHub if you'd like to get in contact
